Media-LibMTP
============

Media-LibMTP is a Perl module that helps you transfer files to or from
a portable media player using the [Media Transfer Protocol (MTP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Transfer_Protocol) as implemented by [libmtp](http://libmtp.sourceforge.net). It builds on [Media::LibMTP::API](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Media::LibMTP::API) to provide a higher-level, more Perl-friendly interface to libmtp.

This is a Git repository where development of Media-LibMTP takes place.  For more information, visit [Media-LibMTP on CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Media-LibMTP/).
